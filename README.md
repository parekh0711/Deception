# Deception

Deception is a game similar to the commonly played roleplay game called Mafia.

The players are divided into two teams, Service and Virus.
The Virus team knows who they are, whereas Service do not.
After the roles are assigned, there is one round in which every person gets some information. After this, voting is held based in this information, and the team member who gets lynched makes his/her team lose.
